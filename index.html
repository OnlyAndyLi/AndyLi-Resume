        As time passed by countless games were developed and made which prompted me to get more excited and anxious about making my own. I started to attend any events/conventions that involved creators/developers of famous video games as I 
        wanted to get more of a grasp on what I was gonna get into. My enthusiasm was strengthened as I dove right into my first class in computer science, the world of coding has widened my mind and led me to see the world differently as lines 
        of statements determined whatever creation I would bring up. Even though I was in the introduction to coding/computer science I had amibitions that brought me to my class's professor, where I ask about the necessary skills for making a game 
        and his advice on how to make one. <br><br>
